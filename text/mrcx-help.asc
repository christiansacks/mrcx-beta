|15GENERAL INFORMATION|07

  mrcX is a chat client used to chat on Multi Relay Chat (MRC). mrcX is also
  without any proper pronunciation. In fact, you can't say it, as it has no
  vowels. But that is okay, it is meant to be used, not spoken. <waves hands
  around in a needlessly confusing Jedi-like manner>
  
  The input field supports tab completion and other editing functions. You
  may press ESC to clear the current entered text.
  
  (Not implemented yet)This client has integration with Johnny5. For more
  information about Johnny5, please visit https://erb.pw/j5-help.
   
|12PRIVACY NOTICE|07

  MRC as a protocol is currently unencrypted. Until the protocol 
  specification is updated, I (roovis) cannot do anything to make your msgs
  more secure. This means your SysOp can read your private messages, as they
  are sent cleartext to other BBSes. Therefore, you should use caution when
  using private message chats with other users on MRC. Assume they're being
  read by other users, because they certainly are.

|15TRIBUTE|07

  Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The
  round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.
  They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You
  can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only
  thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push 
  the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we
  see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change
  the world, are the ones who do. -Steve Jobs
